### My Story ###

My involvement with programming started as a child. My dad loved computers and I followed in his footsteps. They used to publish magazines with programs written in BASIC that you could type in and run yourself, and it was here that I received my child hood education in programming. This led to my first technology triumph. In 1985, at the age of 10, I coded a primitive version of Space Invaders. It ran on the family Texas Instruments TI-994A, which was a glorified video game console that included a built in keyboard and the BASIC programming language. 

As I grew up, I developed a passion for playing jazz and writing poetry. In the nineties, after studying Music Composition and English, I explored ways to combine art and technology. I coded Python scripts to algorithmically generate source material for my musical compositions. Other scripts from this time wrote weird surrealist poems.

Around 2000, I began working with web-based languages and technologies, such as HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and ActionScript Flash. I built music artist websites, MP3 players, and 2D Flash video games. I realized that if I continued to learn and grow, there were no limits to what I could code. As my skills developed, I took on freelance projects. 

Finally, in 2007, I went looking for a job as a full time web developer. And thus it was that my career as a software developer began.
