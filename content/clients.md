#### PushMonetization.com ####

I was the sole developer for a Push Notification system that included a dashboard built with Ruby on Rails, a message queue (RabbitMq), a client side service worker utilizing asyncronous JavaScript, NodeJs, and AWS technologies for scaling such as Redshift, Lambda, Cloudfront, and Kinesis Firehose.

#### 1xRun ####

I worked as Chief Technology Officer at 1xRun. I was hired primarily to fix 1xRun's high traffic e-commerce site. The site suffered from a great deal of poorly written, untestable code, and some pages and database queries were extremely slow. I fixed numerous bugs, and with the help of data supplied by New Relic, was able to identify and optimize the slowest website components; as a result, site performance was significantly improved, with some operations performing 100-1000x times faster. I also helped integrate shipping automation into our website, leading to substantial productivity increases in the shipping department, and built new CMS and blogging tools to improve UX workflows for users adding new products and content.

#### Liquid Thread ####

While freelancing at Liquid Thread, I worked as a full-stack developer on several major corporate websites. Some have since been redesigned, but the the sites listed below are essentially unchanged since I worked on them. All these sites used a custom **Ruby on Rails CMS** (originally created by Liquid Thread's primary developer), with a significant front-end component created using **Backbone, Handlebars, and CoffeeScript.**

Example Liquid Thread websites: 

* www.beamsuntory.com
* www.effenvodka.com
* www.sauzatequila.com	

#### AskBlue Medicare / AskBlue Federal ####

I was the sole full-stack and interactive developer on the AskBlue projects while working with Sandstorm Design as both employee and contractor. I created an **ActionScript 3 game engine** with branching choose-your-own adventure logic (a directed acyclic graph) and synchronized audio and animation for the front-end. The client had requested that we run the app on Microsoft servers, so on the back end, I used PHP with the Kohana framework, and a Microsoft SQL database. I created a full back end reporting and analytics engine, and also ported parts of the game engine to PHP<, which gave us the option of creating a version of the site that screen readers could access.

#### Vets Prevail ####

While working with Vets Prevail, I developed an advanced multimedia e-learning engine that utilized choose-your-own-adventure type branching logic. The engine was used to teach cognitive-behavioral therapy to veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The front-end for the e-learning software was coded with Flash ActionScript 3, and Ruby on Rails was used for the back end.
