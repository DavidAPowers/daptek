                <h3>Bio: Piano & Composition</h3>

                    <p>
                        Powers began 
                        playing piano professionally at the age of 15. As a composer and improviser, 
                        he seeks inspiration from natural beauty and from the rich heritage of 
                        traditional and contemporary music making in the global community. 
                        His sound references jazz, soul, gospel, blues, funk, avant-garde, 
                        Detroit techno, and European classical. In his quest to unify jazz, 
                        classical, and non-Western musical forms, he is developing an 
                        approach to music theory called Ecophonics, and is currently 
                        working to establish free Ecophonics Jazz Workshops in Detroit. His 
                        influences include classical composers Beethoven, Schubert, Debussy, 
                        and Mahler, and jazz pianists Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, 
                        Horace Silver, Herbie Hancock and Alice Coltrane. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Powers studied composition under the late C. Curtis-Smith. He has performed with such jazz luminaries as Roscoe Mitchell, William Parker, Billy Hart, and John Patitucci. As a professional pianist, he has performed in a diverse range of settings, and previous employers include Seabourn Cruise Line, the Hyde Park School of Ballet, and the Columbia College School of Dance. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bio: Electronic Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        Powers programmed his first drum machine at the age of 11, but it wasn't until
                        the year 1999, under the pseudonym Cyborg K, that Powers began playing 
                        all hardware techno live PA's at underground parties in Kalamazoo 
                        and Detroit, alongside techno masters such as Jay Denham, Dan Bell, 
                        and Oliver Ho. Over the years, he refined his sound, branching into 
                        deep house and minimal, and producing tracks for labels such as Hej, 
                        Klectik, Akbal Music, Fresh Meat Records, and Cryovac.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having recently relocated from Chicago to Detroit, Powers continues to 
                        evolve as a producer and DJ, delving ever deeper into the universe 
                        of sound on his quest for the ultimate spiritual vibration.
